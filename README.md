# 🏥 HealthLens: Unlocking Diabetes Patient Insights with SQL + Excel

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a real-world **diabetes hospital dataset** using **SQL** and **Excel**.  
The goal is to identify key patterns in **readmissions, age distribution, procedures, and hospital trends**.  

By combining SQL queries with Excel visualizations, we turned raw healthcare data into actionable insights for doctors and hospital managers.

## 🔍 Business Questions & Answers

### **Q1. Which age groups are readmitted the most?**
- **Query:** Count of patients readmitted grouped by age.
- **Insight:** Helps identify which age groups need more follow-up care.

### **Q2. What are the most common primary diagnoses?**
- **Query:** Top 10 primary diagnoses by frequency.
- **Insight:** Reveals the most common health issues requiring hospital attention.

### **Q3. Which hospitals admit the highest number of patients?**
- **Query:** Patient count grouped by hospital ID.
- **Insight:** Highlights workload distribution across hospitals.

### **Q4. Which medical procedures are performed most frequently?**
- **Query:** Count of procedures grouped by procedure type.
- **Insight:** Shows resource demand and planning needs.

### **Q5. What is the average hospital stay duration per age group?**

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Charts** → Top 10 diagnoses, procedures, hospital admissions  
- **Column Charts** → Readmissions by age group  
- **Line Chart** → Avg. stay duration by age

## 💡 Key Insights
1. Senior patients show the highest **readmission rates**, suggesting a need for better post-discharge care.  
2. A small set of **diagnoses dominate hospital admissions**, highlighting priority areas for healthcare intervention.  
3. A handful of hospitals handle a disproportionate share of cases — these may need extra staffing/resources.  
4. Certain procedures are performed **far more frequently**, which can help optimize supply chain management.  
5. Average hospital stay varies sharply by age, useful for hospital bed capacity planning.
